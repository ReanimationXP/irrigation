# Irrigation

This is the start of Ianâ€™s Farm irrigation project.
Utilizes Particle.io Electron platform.
Data is hosted via an Adafruit.io feed, and data writes are triggered through IFTTT

# To Do:
- Implement control from Adafruit.io
- Implement scheduling based on real time
	- Implement backup system for no-connectivity failover schedule maintenance
- Implement RGB-backlit LED
- Implement Humidity/Temperature monitoring and control
- Implement LED control
	- Simulate Seasonal Conditions via RGB LEDs
	- Need to research proper wavelengths with brightest elements we can find
- Implement Camera and Motion Detection
- Design and Implement microbe delivery
	- Microbes are refrigerated, need to deliver to some chamber, agitate for 5 mins, 	then spray on soil. Definitely need a separate pump and irrigation lines with misting heads.

# Remote functions are:
**relayTest** - Tests all relays.
**startPhase(**phaseNumber**)** - Start the provided phase.
**nextPhase** - Skip the current phase and continue to the next.

# Remote variables are:
anemoValue - this is the pin readout from anemometer
windSpeed - this is the mapped value of voltages, giving accurate wind speed readings
hygro1 - first hygrometer sensor
hygro2 - second hygrometer sensor
soilAvg - average readout of all hygrometers

# Current setup:
Delay-based, but with an onboard RTC, so accurate to real time. Every 12 hours, perform the following phases:
- Phase 1: Enable pump, begin watering Row 1 for x minutes
- Phase 2: Close Row 1, begin watering Row 2 for x minutes
- Phase 3: Close Row 2, begin Sprinklers for x minutes
- Phase 4: Stop sprinklers, stop Pump.
- Phase 5: Idle for 12 hours.
